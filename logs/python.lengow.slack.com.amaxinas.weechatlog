I don't know if you remember anymore but when I worked on cdon thesaurus synchronization for V2 I found some Excel file with some categories but afterwards you provided me an xml file with much more categories and i've used that for synchronization on V2( They specified somewhere that they provide this xml to the client, but I don't know how). Using the same xml on V3 I found an issue, because the core searches for a parent of a thesaurus line. In v2 you provided the thesaurus dict and the core did just an insert. 
2016-07-06 12:19:07		At a closer look I found the issue being in the xml.
2016-07-06 12:19:07		They have a root category named Physical(level 0). Each level 1 category should be found here as a child of root category; ex.:
2016-07-06 12:19:07		            <Value displayName="Physical / BusinessAndIndustrial">BusinessAndIndustrial</Value>
2016-07-06 12:19:07		The problem is that for some of the children categories the parent isn't mapped in the xml. So for this line
2016-07-06 12:19:07		            <Value displayName="Physical / SportsAndLeisure / ExerciseAndFitness">ExerciseAndFitness</Value> 
2016-07-06 12:19:07		this line is missing
2016-07-06 12:19:07		           <Value displayName="Physical / SportsAndLeisure">SportsAndLeisure</Value>
2016-07-06 12:19:24	⤷	I hope I explained correctly
2016-07-06 12:19:50	⤷	This doesn't happen only on level 1 categories, of course :slightly_smiling_face:
2016-07-06 12:24:41	⤷	Should we ask them for a correct xml or do you think we should try to create lines even for the parent that are not in the xml? I think there may be a way to get the parents that are not in there and create separate lines for them.
